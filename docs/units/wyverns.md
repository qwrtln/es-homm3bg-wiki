## Notas

- **Pocos and Pack** - Enemy units, that were attacked by the Wyverns, receive damage on each activation, as long as there is at least one faction cube on them.
- **Pocos and Pack** - If [Trolls](trolls.md) or [Espectros](wraiths.md) were attacked by the Wyverns, both the damage and the healing take place simultaneously. This means [Trolls](trolls.md) only remove up to 2 :damage:. Nothing happens for faction (Pocos and Pack) [Espectros](wraiths.md), and their Neutral variant removes up to 1 :damage:.
